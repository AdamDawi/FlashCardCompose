# ScratchCardCompose
This project provides a customizable flashcard component in Jetpack Compose. The flashcard supports interactive features such as flipping on tap and swiping left or right.

## ‚≠êÔ∏èFeatures
### Flip Animation:
Uses rotation along the Y-axis to create a flipping effect with ``cameraDistance``.
- Rotation values range from 0f to 180f to simulate a full flip.
- Alpha blending ensures only one side is visible at a time when the animation is complete.

### Swipe Animation: 
Smooth swipe animations with rotation on the Z-axis.
- **Card Slide Out of View:** Cards smoothly slide out of the screen when swiped.
- **Border Color Indications:** Highlights the card border when approaching a swipe threshold.

### Customizable Design:
Modify text, colors, shapes, and more to match your app's theme.

## ‚öôÔ∏èInstallation
To use this component in your Jetpack Compose project, simply copy the ``Flashcard`` composable into your project and customize it with your own text and styling.

## üìùUsage Example
Here‚Äôs an example of how to use the ScratchCard component:
```kotlin
  Flashcard(
    frontText = "Front of the card",
    backText = "Back of the card",
    height = 480.dp,
    width = 320.dp,
    onSwipeLeft = { /* Handle swipe left */ },
    onSwipeRight = { /* Handle swipe right */ }
)
```

## üîçHow it works
The flashcard component is built using a layered rendering approach:
1. **Flip Animation (Front and Back Sides):**
- **Rotation (Y-Axis):**
  -  The card rotates around the Y-axis when flipped. Initially, the card shows the front side, and upon flip, it rotates 180¬∞, revealing the **back side**.
- **Alpha Animation (Opacity Transition):**
  - The **front side** fades out (opacity 0) as the card rotates.
  - Simultaneously, the back side fades in (opacity 1), creating a seamless transition between the two sides.
2. **Swipe Animation::**
- **Drag Detection:**
  - The card‚Äôs position (``cardOffsetX``, ``cardOffsetY``) is updated using ``detectDragGestures``.
  - The border color changes based on drag direction, and the swipe direction (left or right) is determined by the drag threshold (``SWIPE_GESTURE_THRESHOLD``).
- **Swipe Completion:**
  - If the drag exceeds the threshold, the card moves off-screen horizontally by 1.5 times the ``screenWidth`` and rotates back to 0¬∞. The appropriate callback (``onSwipeLeft`` or ``onSwipeRight``) is triggered, and the card resets.
- **Reset Position:**
  - After the swipe, the card‚Äôs position and border color reset to their initial state.
